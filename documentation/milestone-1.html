    <title>Tag Along Constructions</title>
<body>
    <h1>Purpose</h1>
        <p>This website provides several sections on a container bin house development, green house/raised garden beds
            / classic farming development, entertainment activities development (beehives, target range, sunken fire pit,
            glamping/camping sites), and a contact input area. The contact input area is for audience members to contact
            me in how s/he/they would like to be involved.</p>
    <h1>Audience</h1>
        <p>Audience will include family & friends too far out of reach for a phone call or personal visit. These contacts
        would be located beyond the state of New Mexico, or even local Mountain Time Zone. Travelers of the Continental Divide
        are included as audience, based on that hiking trail passing right along my property area. The property will include
        camping sites for such hikers, and other people exploring the local Cuba, N.M. surrounding landscapes. I also see this
        Tag Along Constructions as a model for other construction projects to introduce a wider audience via 'The Web'.
        Perhaps a community park/library taking on open gardens construction, or a city property being developed and have
            surrounding community members involved with that development.</p>
    <h1>Goal</h1>
        <p>To increase awareness beyond my circle of friends/family of this House Construction, Gardening area construction,
        Activity centered construction such as bee hives, target range for handheld items, sunken firepits, 'floating'
        cabin within/above arroyo and have those interested in helping, be able to do so.</p>

    <h1>Persona</h1>
        <h2><strong>Name:</strong></h2>
            <p>Spencer Arnold</p>
        <h2><strong>Age:</strong></h2>
            <p>33</p>
        <h2><strong>Profession:</strong></h2>
            <p>Consulting and Coaching on Product Marketing, of own Consulting Company.THey have
        begun growing more staff and outreach of this business beyond the service area of the greater Albuquerque-Santa Fe
        areas. This business is still in the 1-2 year start up phase.</p>
        <h2><strong>Technology:</strong></h2>
            <p>Apple products are used for the Consulting Company. MacBook Pro(s) are utilized for
            staff, and Spencer uses his MacBook Pro for both professional and personal uses. Ipads are used to show visual ideas
            for customers and even host meetings for staff while out on travel. Spencer uses iPhone 16 plus for all communication
            with his staff, family and customers. When out in rural areas with no internet service, Spencer uses Starlink
            services.</p>
        <h2><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong></h2>
            <p>Traveling to customers most days of work, planning business growth and
        retention, and intense outdoor activities being planned. Spencer will work with staff via Zoom meetings for 15 minutes max,
        and provide customers with 1.5 hours on up of time. Spencer is a huge outdoor traveler with hiking the Continental
        Divide Trail, Wheeler Peak camping trips and winter hikes. He posts pictures of these experiences on his social media
        accounts.</p>
        <h2><strong>Frustrations and Needs</strong></h2>
            <p>Spencer needs to balance his work life schedules with what he enjoys in
        the outdoors. Weekend getaways have slowly disappeared as he grows his Consulting Company. Evenings are being replaced
        with reviewing notes from meetings with customers and no longer planning a Fall Foliage Trip into the Santa Fe National
        Forest areas. Spencer needs to get off tech and back into hiking boots.</p>
        <h2><strong>Goals:</strong></h2>
            <p>Spencer is concerned about a balance work-not work lifestyle. He notices the Tag Along
        Construction website from his college friend. Spencer likes the concepts of being involved in projects that he finds
        of interest, primarily the camping experience. He has hiked portions of the Continental Divide Trail with a drop off
        by friend/family and pick up at the end of his hiking distance. Having a set camping location near the trail will
        help Spencer to be outdoors much more and away from work.</p>
        <h2><strong>User Story:</strong></h2>
            <p>As a casual user, I need to find exactly the outdoor experience I need to give
        my work life a break and my outdoor life growth.</p>

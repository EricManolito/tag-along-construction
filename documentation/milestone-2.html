    <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
        <p>The webpage will have a nav bar at the top right area of the page. This will not take the user to another
        webpage, but take you further down the single webpage. Title of Tag Along Constructions will  be on the right, both
        in the header.</p>
        <p> The next section is for the House Development. There will be a featured photo of the house foundation site
        stretching across the entire page of that top section (In a future webpage, I'm wanting to show a video clip in that
            area). Below that image on the right will be written text about how the house is being built. Such as container
        bin material(s), use of solar power as primarily energy use, etc. Beside that text on the left will be a smaller
        image of either what the house is going to look like, or a simple blueprint image of that house.</p>
        <p>The next section will be of the Farming/ Gardening section. This will be divided into two halves, left and right.
        Left side will have text explaining the farming techniques/approaches. On the right will be a large photo of the
        </p>
        <p>The third section will be in two halves, left and right. Left will have a header with text of Experiences (word
        choice is still being determined). Under that header will be listed beehives with some detail sentencces below that;
        followed by Glamping/Camping and detailed sentence(s); third listed item will be target range followed by detailed
        sentences about that. On the right side of the section is a Name input field with button below, followed by
        Email and input field with button below, and a text area with filler question to show what to type and a button
        above that.</p>

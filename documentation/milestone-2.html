    <h1>Content Strategy</h1>
        <p>The webpage will have a nav bar at the top right area of the page. This will not take the user to another
        webpage, but take you further down the single webpage. Title of <strong>Tag Along Constructions</strong> will  be on the right, both
        in the header.</p>
    <hr>
        <p> The next section is for the <strong>House Development</strong>, which will be in large text. There will be a featured photo
            of the house foundation site stretching across the entire page of that top section (In a future webpage,
            I'm wanting to show a video clip in that area). Below that image on the left half of remaining section will
            be written text about how the house is being built. Such as container bin material(s), use of solar power as
            primarily energy use, etc. Beside that text on the right will be a smaller image of either what the house
            is going to look like, or a part of a blueprint image of that house. When the page goes into mobil view, that
        house image/ blueprint will not be in the mobile view.</p>
    <hr>
        <p>The next section will be of the <strong>Farming/ Gardening</strong> (in large text size/bold) section. This will be divided into
            two halves, left and right. Left side will have text explaining the farming techniques/approaches. On the right
            will be a large photo of the area where crops will be grown/ raised garden bed area cleared.
            Maybe the photos change out?</p>
    <hr>
        <p>The third section will be in two halves, left and right. Left will have a header with text of <strong>Experiences</strong>
            (word choice is still being determined). Under that header will be listed beehives with some detail sentences below that;
        followed by Glamping/Camping and detailed sentence(s); third listed item will be Target Range followed by detailed
        sentences about that. On the right side of the section is a Name input field with button below, followed by
        Email and input field with button below, and a text area with filler question to show what to type and a button
        above that. I'm still figuring out what that header of that last section will be. Maybe something like Contact Form?</p>
